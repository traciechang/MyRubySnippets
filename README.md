# MyRubySnippets

[Live Site]()

MyRubySnippets is a cloud-based IDE for writing and running Ruby Code in your browser, and allows users to easily collaborate with team members and see each other type in real time.

### Features
* Single-page web application with a `Rails` RESTful API built with `React` and `Redux`.
* Integrated with the OmniAuth library for multi-provider authentication, including Google, GitHub, and LinkedIn.

* Collaborate with team members by simply sharing the unique snippet link - others do not need to create an account in order to work on a snippet with you.
* ActionCable is used to implement WebSockets and allows users to see each other type in real time.
* Embedded Ace code editor.

### Code Spotlight

**Real Time Programming with ActionCable**
* A snippet can be worked on by multiple users simultaneously and users can see each other type in real time. This is achieved by using `ActionCable` to implement WebSockets.
* Users must be authenticated in order to create a shared snippet. 
* When a shared snippet is created, a unique link is generated that can be shared and used to pair program with anyone - no login is required to work on a snippet.
* Every user on this snippet becomes a subscriber to this snippetâ€™s channel. As a user types, changes are broadcasted via the `onChange` event and all other users on this snippet can see the typing in real time.

### ToDo
* Add a Reset Link feature to let users generate a new unique snippet link when they no longer want others to access a certain snippet.
* Enhance Snippet collaboration with a list of all users currently working on a snippet.
* Allow users to track changes made by each team member.
